## Hello Everyone , we hope after going to all of those tutorials provided in the readme file you're familiar with how to code and use an arduino ide.So if we start with the inbuilt blinking an led it won't be fun.So that's why we bring you your very first arduino project that will be easy as well as useful in your day-to-day life.

## Task description:
* There are different types of thermometers available for different purposes. The most commonly found thermometer is a medical or clinical thermometer, which is a mercury in     glass type thermometer.

* They are used to measure the temperature of human body and is an example of an analogue thermometer. Now a days, the use of digital thermometers is increasing as they are     accurate and safe to use.

* In this project, an Arduino based digital thermometer is designed that can be used to monitor the temperature of room.

### Expected output

* from the output provided you can get a knowledge about the circuit connection, now all of you must be thinking about how we can use all these hardware components in this lockdown ?? for that you need to visit the following link and you have to simulate the thermometer you have made and you have to submit the screen shot of your simulation with your code.

* tinkercard :- <a>https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard</a>
* Here you will meet a new problem i.e. lcd display and arduino integration for that refer to the following blog.

 #### Now we think all of the above links are enough to complete this task but as you're new to tinkercard and online hardware simulation  so we're providing the youtube link that will be helpful for you to completing the task,because the upcoming tasks will be much more than this

  ### Hint:- all you have to do is to think about your small piece of code to just print the temperature
  
  
  #### submit your task1 before 03/11/2020
  
  
  # Good Luck
