* ## The main moto of this repo will be learning different hardware topics as well as also gaining knowledge on opensource.
### step:-1
* fork this repository
* As we are going to start with basics of arduino programming so you have to create one file i.e. yourname.ino file and update the table provided in this readme.md file
